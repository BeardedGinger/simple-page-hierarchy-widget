Displays the most logical arrangement of Parent, Child, & Grandchild pages.

== Description ==

Designed to display the Parent, Child, and Grandchild hierarchy in the most straightforward way out of the box. 

This plugin will provide a widget that locks the Parent page as the widget title. 

If this is a child of the top parent, the widget will display the Parent as the title of the widget and a ul of links for all siblings of the current page.

If this is a grandchild of the top parent, the Widget will display the same as the scenario above with the addition of a sub ul of all siblings of this grandchild. 

Test it out, if it doesn’t work like you want out of the box, this plugin isn’t for you.
